# ðŸ§¾ Compiler Design Lab â€“ Lex Programs

This repository contains **Lex (Flex)** programs implemented as part of my **Compiler Design Laboratory** course.  
Each program demonstrates different phases and concepts of lexical analysis including token recognition, pattern matching, symbol counting, and filtering input streams.

## ðŸ“Œ About Lex (Flex)

Lex (or Flex) is a **lexical analyzer generator** used to identify tokens from input text.  
It works alongside a parser (e.g., YACC/Bison) and serves as the first phase of a compiler.

In this lab, I used Lex to:
- Recognize patterns using regular expressions
- Tokenize input text
- Count occurrences of specific characters or words
- Classify lexical elements (keywords, identifiers, etc.)
